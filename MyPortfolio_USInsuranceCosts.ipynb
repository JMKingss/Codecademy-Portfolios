    "\n",
    "##### Age\n",
    "\n",
    "    · The verage age is 39. Taking into account the wide range of ages of the sample ([18,64]), it is logical.\n",
    "    · It could be useful for a more profound analysis to asses the number of patients by age, in order to discuss possible biases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Sex\n",
    "\n",
    "    · The anal_sexes methos shows that both genders are equally well represented in the sample. The only way there could be any bias via this category would be if the genders were not uniformmly distributed among ages. That it, most women could be youngsters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Smoking status\n",
    "\n",
    "    · A 1/5 of the patients are smokers. \n",
    "##### Number of children\n",
    "\n",
    "    · The average of children is of 1 per patient. Since half of the sample have children, we can infer that those who have children have more tan one indeed. Thus must have compensated the fact that the other half does not have any offsprings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Region\n",
    "\n",
    "    · 4 regions were distinguised:\n",
    "        {'southwest': 324, 'southeast': 363, 'northwest': 324, 'northeast': 323}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    · Again, we must highlight how apparently well scattered the dataset is. Yet, it is hard to derive any conclusion from this as we cannot tell whether a region lacks of variety or not. For instance, smokers and parents could be concentrated in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Charges\n",
    "\n",
    "    · Data speaks by itself: (('Average:', 13270), ('Range:', ['10043.249', '9991.03765']))\n",
    "    · *NOTE: the range is too closed to acquire any deeper conlusion, as no association can be made with the other variables. This is, we cannot relate having high charged with a higher number of children.\n",
